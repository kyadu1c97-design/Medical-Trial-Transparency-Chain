# ClinicalTrialChain

## Project Description

ClinicalTrialChain is a blockchain-based platform that brings transparency and accountability to medical clinical trials. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this project creates an immutable, publicly auditable record of all clinical trial registrations, methodologies, and resultsâ€”whether positive, negative, or neutral.

The platform prevents selective reporting and data manipulation by ensuring that once a trial is registered, its methodology is locked on-chain, and all results must be published regardless of outcome. Independent researchers can verify published results, creating a peer-review layer built into the blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to eliminate publication bias in medical research and create a world where:

- **Every clinical trial is traceable** from registration to completion
- **Negative results are valued** as much as positive ones, preventing duplicate research
- **Pharmaceutical companies cannot hide** unfavorable data
- **Patients and doctors** can make truly informed decisions based on complete data
- **Research integrity** is enforced through cryptographic proof, not trust

By making clinical trial data immutable and transparent, we aim to accelerate medical breakthroughs, reduce research waste, and ultimately save lives.

## Key Features

âœ… **Trial Registration** - Researchers register trials with methodology locked on-chain before starting  
âœ… **Mandatory Result Publishing** - All results (positive, negative, neutral) must be published on completion  
âœ… **IPFS Integration** - Full datasets stored on IPFS with hash recorded on blockchain for data integrity  
âœ… **Peer Verification** - Independent researchers can verify published results for credibility  
âœ… **Researcher Credentialing** - Only verified researchers can register trials (prevents spam)  
âœ… **Immutable Audit Trail** - Complete history of all trials with timestamps that cannot be altered  
âœ… **Public Access** - Anyone can query trial data and results for transparency

## Future Scope

ðŸ”® **Patient Consent Management** - Blockchain-based informed consent tracking with revocable permissions  
ðŸ”® **Multi-Phase Tracking** - Separate structures for Phase I, II, III trials with stage-specific data  
ðŸ”® **Tokenized Incentives** - Reward researchers for publishing negative results and peer reviewers for verification  
ðŸ”® **Regulatory Integration** - API connections to FDA, EMA, and other regulatory bodies for automatic compliance  
ðŸ”® **Adverse Event Reporting** - Real-time, immutable logging of adverse events during trials  
ðŸ”® **Meta-Analysis Tools** - Smart contracts that aggregate data across similar trials for research synthesis  
ðŸ”® **NFT Certificates** - Issue NFTs to trial participants as proof of contribution to medical science  
ðŸ”® **Decentralized Peer Review** - DAO-based review system where stake-holders vote on data quality  
ðŸ”® **Cross-Chain Bridge** - Enable data sharing across multiple blockchain networks for global interoperability  
ðŸ”® **AI Fraud Detection** - Integration with AI models to detect statistical anomalies or data manipulation attempts
